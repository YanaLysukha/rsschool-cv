### Briefly About Myself:

I've decided to change my career due to the lack of opportunities in the career leather of my previous work. However, in my previous work, I've improved my soft skill like working with people and stress tolerance. So now I'm learning Frontend Development. I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth, besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
